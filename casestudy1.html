        <h1>Lantern Fly Trap - Design Thinking in Product Design Project</h1>
        <h2 class="heading">Intoduction</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, we were divided into teams where we had to pick an issue that we wanted to design an interface and prototype for. 
            Including myself I was a part of a <b>group of three</b> and we chose to create a product to <b>solve the lantern fly problem</b>. 
            Our problem statement was that lantern flies were infesting Philadelphia and the surrounding areas and we need a way to capture and kill 
            the invasive creatures without intruding on the city.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">My Role</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I was mainly in charge of the <b>background research</b>.
            I looked into why the lantern flies were a problem, what was being done to solve the problem, and some other lantern fly traps
            that were already availiable. I also helped with the analysis. We were a group of three so we each did one form of analysis. I <b>created
            the journey map</b> based on teh results we got back from the interviews. We all created different ideations for our prototype to have
            a total of 20. From there we decided which one was the best and created a very basic prototype.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Our main goal was to create a trap for lantern flies that would attract and store the bugs, was easily put up and taken down, interacted
            with residents through the interface we designed, and could be integrated into a commonly used app. <b>Research was collected and 13 people 
            in Philadelphia were interviewed</b>. From there we created our analysis which included an journey map and a swat analysis. <b>20 ideations</b> with 
            each also having a storyboard to show how to use it were created. We designed a product that would effectively trap and kill lanternflies 
            without intruding on the rest of the city or any other form of wildlife that might come into contact with the trap.

        <h2 class="heading">Final Solution</h2>

        <p>
            We chose one of my ideations to turn into the protype and final design. A few adjustments were made when I learned that birds easily get caught
            in sticky traps. Mesh was added over it to prevent the birds from being caught in the traps. Sap and buckwheat would be included in the sticky
            part of the trap to attract the lantern flies. The trap would be placed around the trunk of a tree and would trap the lantern fly nymphs 
            along with the adults when they walk up the tree trunk or fly onto the tree trunk.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>A very basic protype was created out of cardboard to symbolize the trap and yarn to symbolize the mesh netting that would be around it</b>. 
            Research into the cost of production was also done. The cost to produce the protype if it was created with the actual materials would be 
            around $3.10 per trap. The includes the cost for the biodegradable plastic wrap that would be the inner tube, the glue on each trap, the sap 
            in each trap, the amount of buckwheat included in each, and the mesh netting on each trap. Each individual trap would be sold for $8 but would 
            also be sold in bulk for cheaper per unit.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the interface, it was decided that it would be <b>integrated into an already existing app</b> like Accuweather. It makes subtle changes to the app 
            and <b>doesnâ€™t interfere if users decide not to use it</b>. There would little marketing needed for it as a lot of people already use the Accuweather app.
